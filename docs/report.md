# SecOS Defender: Project Report

## 1. Project Overview

SecOS Defender is a comprehensive security framework designed to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities in operating systems. The project addresses critical security challenges by implementing a multi-layered approach to vulnerability detection, focusing specifically on buffer overflows, trapdoors, and cache poisoning attacks.

The framework provides:
- Real-time vulnerability detection using both signature-based and behavioral analysis.
- Controlled attack simulation to test system defenses.
- Immediate alerting through a centralized dashboard.
- Actionable remediation guidance to address identified vulnerabilities.

This implementation serves both educational and practical purposes, demonstrating core security concepts while providing a functional security monitoring solution.



## 2. Module-Wise Breakdown

The SecOS Defender framework is divided into five distinct modules, each responsible for specific functionality:

### 2.1 Attack Simulation Engine
This module generates controlled attacks to test the system's detection capabilities. It implements:
- Buffer overflow simulation using specially crafted C programs.
- Trapdoor access attempts through unauthorized privilege escalation.
- Cache poisoning simulation targeting the ARP cache.

The simulation engine operates in a sandboxed environment to prevent actual system damage while providing realistic attack scenarios.

### 2.2 Vulnerability Detection Core
The detection core continuously monitors the system for security vulnerabilities using:
- Address Sanitizer (ASAN) for memory error detection.
- Stack canaries for buffer overflow prevention.
- System call monitoring for identifying unauthorized access.
- Network traffic analysis for cache poisoning attempts.

This module interfaces directly with the operating system to collect runtime data and analyze system behavior.

### 2.3 Alert System
When vulnerabilities are detected, the alert system:
- Logs detailed information about the vulnerability.
- Classifies alerts by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- Maintains an audit trail of all detected issues.
- Triggers notifications through the user interface.

The alert system serves as the central repository for all security events detected by the framework.

### 2.4 Mitigation Advisor
For each detected vulnerability, this module:
- Provides context-specific remediation guidance.
- Suggests code fixes for buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
- Recommends configuration changes to prevent trapdoors.
- Offers network security improvements for cache poisoning prevention.

The advisor draws from a knowledge base of best practices and security patterns.

### 2.5 User Interface
The web-based dashboard:
- Displays real-time alerts with severity indicators.
- Provides detailed vulnerability information.
- Offers visualization of system security status.
- Allows configuration of detection parameters.
- Presents mitigation recommendations in an accessible format.


## 3. Functionalities

### 3.1 Attack Simulation Engine
Simulates attacks such as:
- Buffer Overflow: Generates stack and heap-based overflow conditions using crafted inputs.
- Trapdoor Exploitation: Simulates unauthorized privilege escalation attempts.
- Cache Poisoning: Tests ARP cache poisoning scenarios.

### 3.2 Vulnerability Detection Core
Detects vulnerabilities such as:
- Buffer Overflow: Identifies memory corruption using ASAN or canary-based detection techniques.
- Trapdoor Exploitation: Monitors unauthorized privilege escalations via suspicious commands in logs.
- Cache Poisoning: Flags unsolicited ARP replies or duplicate IP detections in network traffic logs.

### 3.3 Alert System
Generates alerts with detailed information:
- Type of vulnerability detected (e.g., Buffer Overflow).
- Severity classification (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- Timestamp and affected components.

### 3.4 Mitigation Advisor
Provides actionable recommendations:
- Code-level fixes (e.g., bounds checking).
- System configuration changes (e.g., least privilege enforcement).
- Network security enhancements (e.g., traffic filtering).

### 3.5 User Interface
Displays alerts and system status via a Flask-based dashboard:
- Real-time visualization of active alerts.
- API endpoint for programmatic access to alert data.


## 4. Technology Used

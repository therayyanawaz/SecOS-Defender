# SecOS Defender: Project Report

## 1. Project Overview

SecOS Defender is a comprehensive security framework designed to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities in operating systems. The project addresses critical security challenges by implementing a multi-layered approach to vulnerability detection, focusing specifically on buffer overflows, trapdoors, and cache poisoning attacks.

The framework provides:
- Real-time vulnerability detection using both signature-based and behavioral analysis
- Controlled attack simulation to test system defenses
- Immediate alerting through a centralized dashboard
- Actionable remediation guidance to address identified vulnerabilities

This implementation serves both educational and practical purposes, demonstrating core security concepts while providing a functional security monitoring solution.

## 2. Module-Wise Breakdown

The SecOS Defender framework is divided into five distinct modules, each responsible for specific functionality:

### 2.1 Attack Simulation Engine
This module generates controlled attacks to test the system's detection capabilities. It implements:
- Buffer overflow simulation using specially crafted C programs
- Trapdoor access attempts through unauthorized privilege escalation
- Cache poisoning simulation targeting the ARP cache

The simulation engine operates in a sandboxed environment to prevent actual system damage while providing realistic attack scenarios.

### 2.2 Vulnerability Detection Core
The detection core continuously monitors the system for security vulnerabilities using:
- Address Sanitizer (ASAN) for memory error detection
- Stack canaries for buffer overflow prevention
- System call monitoring for identifying unauthorized access
- Network traffic analysis for cache poisoning attempts

This module interfaces directly with the operating system to collect runtime data and analyze system behavior.

### 2.3 Alert System
When vulnerabilities are detected, the alert system:
- Logs detailed information about the vulnerability
- Classifies alerts by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Maintains an audit trail of all detected issues
- Triggers notifications through the user interface

The alert system serves as the central repository for all security events detected by the framework.

### 2.4 Mitigation Advisor
For each detected vulnerability, this module:
- Provides context-specific remediation guidance
- Suggests code fixes for buffer overflow vulnerabilities
- Recommends configuration changes to prevent trapdoors
- Offers network security improvements for cache poisoning prevention

The advisor draws from a knowledge base of best practices and security patterns.

### 2.5 User Interface
The web-based dashboard:
- Displays real-time alerts with severity indicators
- Provides detailed vulnerability information
- Offers visualization of system security status
- Allows configuration of detection parameters
- Presents mitigation recommendations in an accessible format

The UI is built using Flask and modern web technologies to ensure responsiveness and usability.

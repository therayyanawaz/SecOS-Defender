# SecOS Defender: Security Vulnerability Detection Framework

## Project Overview

SecOS Defender is a comprehensive framework designed to detect and mitigate security vulnerabilities in operating systems. The framework focuses on identifying common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, trapdoors, and cache poisoning while providing real-time alerts and actionable remediation strategies.

This project implements a modular security framework that:
- Simulates attacks to test system defenses
- Detects vulnerabilities using multiple detection mechanisms
- Provides real-time alerts through a user-friendly dashboard
- Suggests mitigation strategies for identified vulnerabilities

## Features

- **Buffer Overflow Detection**: Identifies stack and heap-based buffer overflows using Address Sanitizer (ASAN) and canary-based detection
- **Trapdoor Identification**: Monitors system for unauthorized access points and backdoors
- **Cache Poisoning Detection**: Identifies ARP cache poisoning attempts and other cache-based attacks
- **Real-time Alerting**: Logs and displays security alerts through a web-based dashboard
- **Mitigation Advisor**: Provides actionable recommendations for addressing detected vulnerabilities

## System Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or newer
- Python 3.8+
- GCC with Address Sanitizer support
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- 20GB free disk space

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SecOS-Defender.git
   cd SecOS-Defender
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Install system dependencies
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev python3-pip

   # Install Python dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Compile the detection modules:
   ```bash
   cd src/detection
   gcc -fsanitize=address -o buffer_detector buffer_overflow.c
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the detection service:
   ```bash
   python src/detection/detection_service.py
   ```

2. Launch the attack simulator (in a separate terminal):
   ```bash
   python src/simulation/attack_simulator.py
   ```

3. Start the web dashboard:
   ```bash
   python src/ui/app.py
   ```

4. Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:5000`

## Module Structure

The framework consists of five primary modules:

1. **Attack Simulation Engine**: Generates controlled attacks to test system defenses
2. **Vulnerability Detection Core**: Monitors system for security vulnerabilities
3. **Alert System**: Processes and displays security alerts
4. **Mitigation Advisor**: Suggests remediation strategies for detected vulnerabilities
5. **User Interface**: Provides a web-based dashboard for monitoring and management
